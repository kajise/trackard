## ðŸ’¿ Use Laudiolin with style! You can now bring your status anywhere, including your GitHub Profile.

Trackard is a microservice that leverages Laudiolin's ability to play music, display your Rich Presence to Discord and. The ability to get people to know what song you are listening anywhere, including your GitHub Profile is finally here, the wait is now over!

## ðŸ‘‘ So how did this project come to life?
So, when Laudiolin came into being. I genuinely had a plan in mind, "what if you could embed your Laudiolin to show the song you're listening to? Kind of like [Lanyard](https://github.com/Phineas/lanyard), where you can embed it in your GitHub Profile." So I got in touch with the developers of Laudiolin, which is [seiKiMo Inc.](https://github.com/seikimo-inc) and got a public endpoint from one of the executives where it lists the users that are connected to Laudiolin via their servers.

With proper planning and quick thinking (well not really because it took me 8 hours, but really really since the usual time of thinking for me is 1 week), I started the project with a cup of coffee near me. And the basic feature works, I hope deploying this project to production works.
